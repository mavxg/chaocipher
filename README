*Cracking exhibit 1*

open ghci

> :l chaocipher.hs

> pt <- readFile "exhibit-1.pt.txt"
> ct <- readFile "exhibit-1.ct.txt"

Start cracking from somewhere with a fare amount of repetition

> take 2 $ crack (take 50 $ drop 11998 ct) (drop 11998 pt)

you will get back a single key

> rewind (Chao "I  AE QS  DW PH R GOC NTBL" "QYGWJZSKLHP TVU XANECFOIDM") (take 50 $ drop 11998 ct)

now use the key you get back to propagate forward

> take 2 $ crack' (take 1500 $ drop 11998 ct) (drop 11998 pt) (Chao "A   SHIN PTCGB ODEWQ   RL " "XQCTVIGYJHNAM WZEOUFPDSL K")

the key you get back will have a single space on the left ring put the X in it

> rewind (Chao "EHSGILWRMTCYBXKJQUFPADZNOV" "JSRBYWFXOTDLMGVPUKNQACIZHE") (take 1500 $ drop 11998 ct)

you can now play to the end to find out what the last ?????? in the plain text is

> decode (Chao "AYFZSHINJPTCGBUODEWQVXKRLM" "XQCTVIGYJHNAMBWZEOUFPDSLRK") (drop 11998 ct)

you can also rewind the key to the begining (Thanks Moshe Rubin for the typo correction in the ct file)

> rewind (Chao "AYFZSHINJPTCGBUODEWQVXKRLM" "XQCTVIGYJHNAMBWZEOUFPDSLRK") (take 119998 ct)

this gives you the orriginal key used (Chao "AYZNBQDSEFGHLWIKCMOPRTUVJX" "CPEDQRSTIXYLMOZABFVGUHWJKN")

now you can decode the whole message

> decode (Chao "AYZNBQDSEFGHLWIKCMOPRTUVJX" "CPEDQRSTIXYLMOZABFVGUHWJKN") pt

note: you will get an error back on the final newline character.
